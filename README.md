# homebrewmenu
Simple 3DS homebrew menu made from Lua-Player-Plus 3DS.

# How to use
Download all of the scripts and homebrewmenu.3dsx.

Now you can do two things:

1. Rename homebrewmenu.3dsx to boot.3dsx and put it on the root of your SD card so it boots up when you load an exploit.
2. Make a new folder in the 3ds folder named homebrewmenu and put the 3dsx file and the scripts in that folder.
